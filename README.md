## About Minicraft and Minicraft DS

[The original Minicraft](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=398) was developed by Markus "Notch" Persson for the 22nd Ludum Dare game programming competition in December 2011.

Minicraft DS is my ongoing effort to port Minicraft for the Nintendo DS using devkitPro and libnds, for fun and education. It is written in C++ and depends on [Custard](https://github.com/jameskirkwood/ds-custard).

It is based on Notch's original Java source code, which was made available in compliance with the competition's rules. Because of this, Minicraft DS' source code contains sounds, images, names and code fragments similar or identical to elements of Notch's code. Any such elements are Copyright Â© 2011 Markus Persson.
